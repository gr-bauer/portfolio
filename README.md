### 1. Python implementation of sorting algorithms presented in [Harvard's CS50](https://study.cs50.net/binary_search) lecture.

* **Bubble sort**: Adjacent values are swapped until the array is completely sorted. This algorithm gets its name from the way values eventually "bubble" up to their proper position in the sorted array. 

* **Insertition sort**: Data is divided into sorted and unsorted portions. One by one, the unsorted values are inserted into their appropriate positions in the sorted subarray. 

* **Selection sort**: Data is divided into sorted and unsorted portions. One by one, the smallest values remaining in the unsorted portion are selected and swapped over to the sorted portion of the array. 

* **Merge sort**: The basic idea is to handle sorting by dividing an unsorted array in two and then sorting the two halves of that array recursively.
